## Dive into the World of SQL with Danny's Diner Case Study!

Hey fellow data enthusiasts! 👋 I recently took on the 8-Week SQL Challenge by the amazing Danny Ma, and I'm thrilled to share my journey through the first case study: **Danny's Diner**. 🍜🍛

### 🌐 Background
Imagine a world where your love for Japanese food inspires you to open a restaurant! That's exactly what Danny did in 2021 with **Danny's Diner**, specializing in sushi, curry, and ramen. Now, he's turning to data to enhance customer experiences and drive business decisions.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Danny's got questions, and SQL is the answer! From total spending to favorite menu items, he's seeking insights to boost his restaurant's success. Each SQL query unlocks a new layer of understanding.

### 💻 Data Setup
I chose MySQL for this adventure and set up the `dannys_diner` schema. The tables (`sales`, `menu`, and `members`) hold the key to unlocking culinary insights.
